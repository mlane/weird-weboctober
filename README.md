# Weird Web October

A gallery of daily experiments told as a captain’s log through a strange digital world.  
Each day, I follow one theme and build one weird page.  
The log is my record — the experiments are the artifacts I uncover.

Rule: **one weird thing per day, built in ~30 minutes.**

## Captain’s Log

**Day 01 — Transparency**  
I wake up in a world of nothing. Everything feels thin — almost invisible.  
There’s only one faint textbox ahead of me. If I click it, maybe something will reveal itself.

---

**Day 02 — Maps**  
The textbox dissolves, replaced by a crude map drawn in shifting pixels.  
It doesn’t stay still — every refresh shows a new path. Is this place trying to lead me somewhere?

---

**Day 03 — Scramble**  
The map shatters into fragments. Words fall out of order, reassembling themselves differently each time I look.  
It’s hard to know what’s true here. Or if truth even matters.

---

**Day 04 — Filters**  
Suddenly, colors warp. My vision slides between shadows and neon, like someone is toggling filters on reality.  
The world doesn’t change — only the way I see it does.

---

**Day 05 — Remix**  
The landscape keeps rearranging itself. Blocks shuffle, pathways remix, nothing stays put.  
It feels playful, but also… hostile.

---

**Day 06 — Solids**  
I stumble into a wall of solid blocks — unmovable, unchanging.  
For once, something in this world feels stable. Maybe too stable.

---

**Day 07 — Sub-optimal**  
Every step forward takes three steps back. Levers, switches, buttons — all to open one door.  
Why is everything here built the hardest way possible?

---

**Day 08 — Containers**  
I find a box. Inside it, another box. And inside that… more boxes.  
Each one smaller, but each one heavier. Endless nesting.

---

**Day 09 — Blink**  
The horizon flickers. For a moment, the whole world disappears, then returns.  
If I blink at the wrong time, will it vanish for good?

---

**Day 10 — Warning**  
Sirens echo through the void. A bright triangle pulses in front of me, repeating the same word: **STOP**.  
But it doesn’t say what I should stop.

---

**Day 11 — Camera**  
A lens opens above me. I feel watched.  
The world pixelates, like I’m trapped inside someone’s grainy feed.

---

**Day 12 — Battle**  
Two shadows collide, swords clashing in endless sparks.  
They fight for nothing but the right to exist.

---

**Day 13 — Upside-down**  
Gravity flips. The ground becomes the ceiling.  
I stumble, unsure which way is up anymore.

---

**Day 14 — Doubles**  
I see everything twice. Each tree, each block, each thought.  
But one reflection lags just behind the other.

---

**Day 15 — Unicode**  
Symbols flood the air — arrows, stars, characters I don’t recognize.  
They hum like they’re alive.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 16 — Transition**  
The world melts between states.  
Every shift takes too long, stretching time into strange shapes.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 17 — Illumination**  
Darkness swallows everything except a circle of light around me.  
The more I move, the more shadows scatter.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 18 — Trading**  
A figure appears, offering me a trade.  
But what it gives and what it takes never seem equal.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 19 — Bounce**  
Letters ricochet off invisible walls.  
The world feels like a screensaver that forgot how to rest.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 20 — Hidden**  
The page looks empty.  
Only when I drag my hand across the surface do hidden words appear.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 21 — Language**  
Voices speak in a tongue I can’t understand.  
Every time I reload, the dialect changes.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 22 — Memory**  
Cards lie face down, waiting to be flipped.  
Each one reveals fragments of a memory I don’t fully own.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 23 — Style**  
Reality keeps changing outfits. One moment minimalist, the next loud and chaotic.  
The substance stays the same — only the skin shifts.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 24 — Counter**  
A number ticks upward in the distance.  
It’s counting something, but I don’t know what.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 25 — Empty**  
The world falls silent. Just a single dot on the horizon.  
Am I supposed to follow it?  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 26 — Texture**  
The ground beneath me changes feel with each step — stone, grass, dirt, static.  
Every surface is louder than the silence.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 27 — Spell**  
I whisper a word and it glows in the air.  
Letters scatter, reform, and shape reality around me.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 28 — Tables**  
A grid stretches across the horizon, rigid and endless.  
Each row leads to another row, another row, another row.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 29 — Surprise**  
Something jumps out of the shadows — confetti, or a ghost, or both.  
The world laughs at me, not with me.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 30 — Deprecated**  
Outdated code hangs from the sky like broken neon signs.  
Marquees scroll, fonts clash, the whole world feels abandoned.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_

---

**Day 31 — Spooky**  
On the final night, the air grows cold.  
Flickers in the corner of my vision reveal pale shapes watching me.  
October ends, but the world stays haunted.  
_(Link unlocks when built)_
